# A Repo for practicing with Github's VCS and other features.
One of the main issues I was having was with Steps #5 and #6 on Creating and merging branches. For some reason while I was in the feature branch It wouldn't let me push the modified main.cpp file. I solved this by doing a git fetch and it fixed it; although I ended up with multiple commits for the feature branch that were never pushed.
